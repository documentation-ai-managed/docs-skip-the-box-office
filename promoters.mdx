## What is a Promoter account?

Skip The Box Office is a Canadian event and concert ticketing platform. A **Promoter** account is a special role for agencies and real-world tour or event promoters.

With a Promoter account, you can:

- Create and manage events
- Set up ticket structures and pricing
- Sell tickets to attendees
- View real-time sales and performance stats
- Manage attendee registration
- Scan tickets at the venue door using an iOS app
- Receive payouts after your event is complete

Throughout the Promoter docs, the term "purchasers" refers to your event attendees who buy tickets through Skip The Box Office.

## End-to-end Promoter workflow

Use this section to understand the typical flow from getting access as a Promoter to receiving your payout.

<Steps>

<Step title="Apply for a Promoter account" icon="plus">

You start by submitting an application to become a Promoter. This lets the team verify your organization, contact details, and the kind of events you plan to run.

Once approved, your account is granted Promoter access so you can create and manage events and ticketing.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your event" icon="calendar">

After your Promoter access is active, you can create a new event using the online event form.

At a high level you will:

- Add event details such as name, date, time, and venue
- Provide a description, media, and any key attendee information
- Choose whether it is a single date or a series of dates

</Step>

<Step title="Set up tickets and pricing" icon="ticket">

Next, you configure how attendees can buy access to your event.

Typically you will:

- Define one or more ticket types and prices
- Configure quantities and any limits per order
- Decide when tickets go on sale and when sales should end

</Step>

<Step title="Publish and start selling" icon="rocket">

When your event and ticketing are ready, you publish the event. Skip The Box Office handles online sales and ticket delivery to attendees.

You can share your event link in your own marketing channels and track sales as they come in.

</Step>

<Step title="Monitor sales and manage attendees" icon="bar-chart">

Once sales begin, you can use your Promoter tools to:

- Monitor real-time sales and revenue
- Review order and attendee details
- Handle basic attendee management, such as name changes where supported

</Step>

<Step title="Scan tickets on event day" icon="monitor">

On the day of your event, you and your team can use the iOS scanning app to validate tickets at the door.

This helps you quickly check in attendees, reduce fraud, and keep entry lines moving.

</Step>

<Step title="Receive payout after the event" icon="dollar-sign">

After your event ends and the standard settlement process completes, you receive your payout.

Depending on your arrangements, this may include a summary of sales, fees, and net amounts transferred to you.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Seating layouts and assigned seating

<Callout kind="info">

Assigned seating layouts are limited and available by **custom request** only. They are typically reserved for high-priority promoters or events where a seating map is essential. If your event requires a seating layout, contact the team well in advance to discuss options.

</Callout>

If your event does not use an assigned seating layout, tickets are usually sold as general admission or by simple sections or ticket types.

## What Promoter access unlocks

Promoter access gives you a set of tools built on top of Skip The Box Office&apos;s WordPress and Elementor based site, powered by The Events Calendar and Events Tickets plugins.

At a high level, you can:

- **Own your event listings**: create, update, and remove your events as needed.
- **Control ticket structures**: define ticket types, pricing, and availability.
- **View live performance**: track ticket sales, revenue, and capacity in real time.
- **Run the door efficiently**: scan and validate attendee tickets with the iOS app.
- **Get paid**: receive payouts after events, with clear visibility into what was sold.

As your volume grows, the team can work with you on more advanced setups and workflows where appropriate.
