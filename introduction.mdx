## What Skip The Box Office is

Skip The Box Office is a Canadian event and concert ticketing platform where you can list local events and sell tickets online.

Promoters use the platform to:

- Check in attendees at the venue using an iOS app
- Track sales and attendance in real time
- Receive payouts after the event is complete

Skip The Box Office runs on a WordPress and Elementor website, powered by The Events Calendar Pro, The Events Calendar: Community Events, and Events Tickets Plus. You do not need to know these tools to use the platform, but this context can help your technical team understand how it is implemented.

## Who this documentation is for

This documentation is written primarily for **Promoters**.

Promoters are agencies and real-world tour or event organizers who:

- Want to promote their events on Skip The Box Office
- Need to configure ticketing and manage attendee lists
- Use the iOS app at the venue door to scan tickets

If you are a **ticket buyer**, you usually do not need these guides. You can:

- Purchase tickets directly from the event page
- Use your email confirmation or ticket PDF at the door
- Contact the promoter or venue if you have questions about a specific event

Promoter access is a special account type. You may need to apply or request an upgrade before you can create and manage events.
