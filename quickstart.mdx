  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure prices and quantities" icon="bar-chart" titleType="p">
    For each ticket type, set the price, total quantity available, and any limits per order if supported. Make sure total capacity matches your venue and safety limits.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure sales window" icon="clock" titleType="p">
    Set when tickets go on sale and when sales should end before the event. Review that the sales start and end times match your announcement plans.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Publish and start selling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preview the event page" icon="monitor" titleType="p">
    Use the event preview in your Promoter Dashboard to confirm event details, ticket options, and pricing appear correctly for attendees.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish the event" icon="rocket" titleType="p">
    When everything looks correct, publish the event so tickets become available for purchase through the platform.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share your ticket link" icon="external-link" titleType="p">
    Copy the public event or ticket page link from your dashboard and share it through your usual promotion channels.

## 5. Monitor real-time sales

<Steps>
  <Step title="Track sales and attendance" icon="bar-chart" titleType="p">
    From your Promoter Dashboard, open the event&apos;s sales or analytics view to see real-time ticket sales, revenue, and remaining inventory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust inventory if needed" icon="edit" titleType="p">
    If allowed, update ticket quantities or close specific ticket types from the event editor as you approach capacity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Prepare the iOS scanning app

    On each check-in device, download and install the Skip The Box Office iOS app from the app store.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in with your Promoter credentials" icon="terminal" titleType="p">
    Use your Promoter account to sign in to the app so it can access your upcoming events and attendee lists.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test scanning before doors open" icon="play-circle" titleType="p">
    Use a test ticket or low-risk order to confirm that scanning works, tickets validate correctly, and the app syncs with your event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Run event day check-in

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the correct event in the app" icon="folder" titleType="p">
    In the iOS app, choose the event you are running so scans update the correct attendee list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scan tickets at the door" icon="zap" titleType="p">
    Use the app to scan each attendee&apos;s ticket at entry. The app will validate tickets and help you manage re-entry policies if supported.

    Keep an eye on check-in counts and outstanding attendees in your Promoter Dashboard or app to track how the event is filling in real time.
