## What Promoter access is

Promoters have a special account type that unlocks tools for running events on Skip The Box Office. With a Promoter account and role, you can typically:

- Create and publish events
- Set up ticket types and pricing
- Track sales and statistics
- Use the attendee scanning app at the door

Promoter access is gated to protect buyers and partners, reduce fraud, and ensure that events on the platform are legitimate and well managed.

You must have a Promoter account and role before you can access Promoter features such as event creation, ticketing, sales reporting, or attendee scanning.

</Callout>

## What to prepare before you apply

You do not need everything perfectly finalized, but having the following information ready will make the application smoother.

### Business or organization details

You will typically be asked for high-level information about who is putting on the events, such as:

- Organization, company, or agency name
- General type of events you plan to run (for example, concerts, theater, festivals, sports)
- Basic location information (for example, city or region)

You do not need to share sensitive documents here; only standard business or organizer details.

### Contact information

Be ready to provide at least one reliable contact so the review team can reach you if they have questions. This often includes:

- Your full name or primary contact name
- An email address that you actively monitor
- A phone number or alternate contact method

Use contact details that you are comfortable using for event-related communication.

### Event history or plans

If you have organized events before, it helps to briefly summarize your experience. Typical examples:

- Past events you have run (type, approximate size, or venues)
- Links to websites or social pages that show your events or organization

If you are new to promoting events, you can instead describe the kind of events you plan to host and how you plan to market them.

### Payout and financial details

To receive ticket revenue, you will eventually need payout information. During or shortly after your Promoter application, you will typically be asked for:

- Where funds should be paid out (for example, a business bank account or payment provider)
- The name that should appear on payout records

You can often submit the initial application before everything is finalized, but you will need accurate payout details before going live with paid events.

<Callout kind="tip">

If you are unsure about specific financial or legal details, you can usually still apply and update your payout information once your Promoter access is approved.

## What happens during review

Once you submit your application, the review process typically follows this pattern:

### Initial review

- Your information is checked to confirm that you are a legitimate organizer.
- Your event history or plans may be reviewed to make sure they fit the platform.
- If anything is unclear, you may receive a follow-up email asking for clarification.

### Approval

If your application is approved:

- Your account is granted the Promoter role.
- Promoter-only tools, such as event creation and ticketing, are unlocked in your dashboard.
- You will usually receive an email confirming that your Promoter access is active.

### Denial or request for more information

If your application is not approved right away:

- You may receive a message explaining that more details are needed.
- In some cases, you may be asked to reapply with updated information or after certain conditions are met.
- If the application is denied, you can typically ask for clarification or reapply later if your situation changes.

## After you are approved

Once your Promoter role is active, you can start using the promoter tools.

### First steps as a new Promoter

Common next steps include:

- Creating your first event
- Setting up ticket types and prices
- Connecting or confirming your payout method
- Reviewing basic reporting and scanning tools

If you are ready to create an event right away, follow the dedicated guide:

<Callout kind="success">

### Custom seating layouts

Seating layouts are not self-service. If you need a reserved seating map or a custom venue layout:

<Callout kind="info">

Custom seating layouts are limited and handled by request. After your Promoter access is approved, contact support or your account representative to ask about enabling a seating layout for your venue.

## Troubleshooting Promoter access issues

If you have applied but do not see Promoter tools or cannot create events, use these checks.

### I applied, but I still do not see Promoter features

- Make sure you are signed in with the same account you used to apply.
- Check your email (including spam or promotions folders) for a message about your application.
- If you see no update after a reasonable time, contact support with:
  - The email address on your account
  - The approximate date you submitted the application
  - Any reference or ticket number you received

### My role looks like a regular user, not a Promoter

- Open your account or profile area and look for any indication of your role.
- If you know your Promoter application was approved but the role is missing:
  - Sign out and sign back in to refresh your session.
  - If the issue persists, contact support and mention that your Promoter role appears to be missing.

### I am approved but cannot create an event

- Confirm that you are in the Promoter or events dashboard, not the general consumer view.
- Look for an option such as "Create event" or "New event".
- If there is no event creation button:
  - Take a screenshot of your dashboard.
  - Contact support with the screenshot and a brief description of what you are trying to do.

### My payout or seating needs are blocking me from going live

- If your payout method is not fully set up, you may be able to build your event and complete payout details later before publishing.
- If you require a custom seating layout, you must request it; it is not something you can enable on your own.
- Reach out to support early in your planning if payouts or seating are critical for your event timeline.

## Summary

- Promoter access is a special, gated role that unlocks event creation, ticketing, sales reporting, and attendee scanning.
- To apply, prepare basic business, contact, event history, and payout information.
- The process is: submit your application, wait for review, and then receive approval or a request for more details.
- After approval, you can start by creating your first event and, if needed, request a custom seating layout.
- If you are missing access or cannot create events after applying, verify your account, check for review emails, and contact support with your application details.
